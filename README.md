# Banking_Data_Analysis
This project focuses on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn in a banking system. The aim is to identify customers who are likely to close their accounts, enabling the bank to take proactive steps—such as providing personalized offers or improved services—to retain them.
